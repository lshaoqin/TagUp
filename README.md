# TagUp
Project submission for CVWO AY22/23

TagUp is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use forum with the unique feature of community tagging, meaning the community can decide what tags should be attached to a post.
Try out the app [here](https://tagup.onrender.com/), or visit its [frontend](https://github.com/lshaoqin/CVWO_frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/lshaoqin/cvwo_forum_backend) repos for more information.
